# Algorithm-to-let-the-robot-works-with-servo-motors

1\ Initialization: setting up the arduino power, connect the Servo Motors and install all the libraries and indendencies.
2\ Setting up the Servo Motors: by attatching it to its pins and setting their positions 
3\ Define the Servo Motors' rotating functions: set the Servo Motors' rotating angle and use to position the Servo 
4\ Controlling the Servo Motors: write the needed functions such as Loop() to repeatedly control the servo and use any sensor to determine the Servo's positions. And it could be 
   updated depending on the giving commands
